# FishTrajectorySimulation
![](https://github.com/MaxNMiller/FishTrajectorySimulation/blob/main/demo.gif)

A computational model designed to simulate the movement of a pelagic fish within a spatial environment characterized by varying biomass distribution. This program was designed as a student project and does not claim to represent a scientifically validated ecological behavior.

## Key Features

- **Gradient-Based Movement:** The program incorporates a gradient-based movement mechanism for the simulated fish. This means that the fish adjusts its trajectory and velocity based on the local gradient of biomass. Essentially, if the fish detects a higher biomass concentration in a certain direction, it is more likely to swim in that direction.

- **Spatial Environment:** The simulation environment is represented as a two-dimensional grid, with each grid cell containing information about the biomass concentration at that location. This allows for the dynamic modeling of an ecosystem where biomass is not evenly distributed.

## Contributions

Developers and researchers interested in ecological modeling and simulations are encouraged to contribute by improving the code, adding new features, or conducting experiments using the simulation.
